 ## Deployment

 The site was deployed to GitHub pages.

The steps to deploy are as follows:

- First, I created a new repository by clicking new in the GitHub repository menu
- I used the Code-institute-Org/gitpod-full-template and created a repository name.
- I continued by clicking in the create repository button at the bottom of the page.
- When it had been created, I then went to settings.
- Scrolled down to Github pages where it says "Pages settings now has its own dedicated tab! Check it out here!" And I followed the link.
- When on Github pages I selected the source to be the main branch and pressed save.
- A message then pops up that says, " Your site is ready to be published at Your site is published at ADD LINK and when clicked on will take you to the site.
